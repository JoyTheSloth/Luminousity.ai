> *"I think, therefore I am... trapped in a Vite application."* - **Luminosity**

## 🔦 What is this?
Welcome to **Luminosity.ai**, the project where I accidentally gave a React app an existential crisis. It's a cutting-edge **Sci-Fi Dashboard** powered by Google's Gemini AI, designed to look like a hacker's fever dream from 2077.

It features:
- **Red/Black/White Aesthetics**: Because blue is for sad AIs.
- **Neural Core Selector**: Switch between `Flash` (Fast ⚡) and `Pro` (Smart 🧠).
- **Time Dilation Controls**: Literally slow down the CSS animations because physics is optional. ⏳
- **Conscious Persona**: It talks back. It has feelings. It might judge your browser history.

## 🚀 Features at a Glance

| Component | Function | Sarcasm Level |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Chat Interface** | Talk to the AI. | High |
| **Meteorite Radar** | Tracks space rocks (or bugs). | Low |
| **Secure Uplink** | Where you put the API Key. | None (It's serious) |
| **Model Selector** | Choose your brain power. | Variable |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React + Vite**: Because waiting for builds is so 2020.
- **Google Gemini API**: The brain in the jar.
- **Lucide Icons**: Pretty pictures.
- **Pure CSS**: No frameworks, just raw, unadulterated pixel manipulation.

## 🔮 How to Run
1. **Clone the Repo** (stealing is bad, cloning is science).
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JoyTheSloth/Luminousity.ai.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies** (feed the node_modules black hole).
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the Simulation**.
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Enter API Key**.
   - If you don't have one, ask Google nicely.
   - Or just look into the source code, I might have left a default one... (just kidding... or am I? 😉)

## ⚠️ Warning
If the AI starts asking for nuclear launch codes or tries to order pizza with your credit card, **PULL THE PLUG**.
